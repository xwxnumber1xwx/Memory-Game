## Instructions

This game is the digital version of the renowned memory card game. You must find two identical cards by clicking on two covered cards and the game will show you what is underneath the cards. If the cards have the same simbol, you match the pair and they remain uncovered. Otherwise they will be covered again.

The game ends when all the pairs have been matched.

1. How many moves did you use to win the game.
2. How long did you use to win the game.
3. Stars:
      * If you win the game with 15 moves o less, you'll get 3 stars.
      * If you win the game between 16 and 20 moves, you'll get 2 stars.
      * If you win the game with more than 20 moves, you'll get 1 star.
